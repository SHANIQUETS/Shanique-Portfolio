# Shanique-Portfolio
I have a strong analytical background in Biochemistry and recently completed a Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning bootcamp. My passion for uncovering meaningful insights through data drives my excitement to step into the field of data science as an entry-level Data Specialist.

Through my training, I've developed a sharp ability to analyze complex datasets and identify patterns and trends. My experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis has strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to generate actionable insights.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always looking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills. Whether working independently or as part of a team, Iâ€™m motivated by the thrill of discovering insights and using data to solve complex problems.
